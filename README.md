# odin-recipes

## Description
This is my first project from The Odin Projects. It features a plain home recipe page with links to several recipes.


## What the project contains
1. A simple home/main page that links to each recipe page.
2. Egusi Recipe
3. Jollof Rice Recipe
4. Garden Egg Stew recipe
5. Image of each food in the recipe

## Tags and Element I Worked With
* `!` - The HTML boiler plate that provided the basic HTML template and structure.  
* `<a>` - The anchor tag for links to the recipes.  
* `<img>` - The image element for adding necessary pictures.
* `li` - The list element to create both ordered list `<ol>` and the undordered list `<ul>`.  
* Header elements `h1>`, `<h2>` and `<h4>`
